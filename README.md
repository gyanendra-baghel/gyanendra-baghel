# Hi there, I'm Gyanendra 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** with a strong foundation in **Machine Learning** and growing expertise in **Cloud & DevOps technologies**. I love building robust and scalable systems—whether it's from the ground up or optimizing existing ones.

My tech journey began back in **Class 10**, and since then, I've been passionate about exploring how software works at every layer of the stack. From crafting intuitive UIs to deploying containerized services in the cloud, I enjoy building systems that are both powerful and purposeful.

I've worked on various full-stack projects and enjoy the intersection of software engineering, ML, and cloud infrastructure. I'm currently diving deeper into **Kubernetes**, having already gained hands-on experience with **Docker** and **Docker Swarm**.

## 🧠 Projects and Libraries

I enjoy building tools that go beyond just "getting it to work"—I aim to understand how things function under the hood. Here are a few projects I've created for learning and experimentation:

- [**fastgo**](https://github.com/gyanendra-baghel/fastgo) – web framework for Go – inspired by Express.js.
- [**Shatranj**](https://github.com/gyanendra-baghel/shatranj) – JS library for chess with HTML canvas ([Demo](https://shatranj-demo.vercel.app/))
- [**Ryxo**](https://github.com/gyanendra-baghel/ryxo) – A lightweight PHP framework ([Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/ryxo/ryxo))
- [**jShort**](https://github.com/gyanendra-baghel/jShort) – DOM manipulation library inspired by jQuery
